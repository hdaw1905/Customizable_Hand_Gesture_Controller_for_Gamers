# Customizable Hand Gesture Controller for Gamers
This project implements a customizable hand gesture controller for gamers using computer vision and machine learning. The system detects hand gestures in real-time video and maps them to various game controller inputs, providing a unique and immersive gaming experience.<br />

# Key Features
» Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition: The system utilizes advanced computer vision algorithms to accurately detect and track hand movements in the video feed.<br />
» Gesture-to-Input Mapping: Detected hand gestures are dynamically mapped to corresponding game controls, such as movement, actions, or menu navigation.<br />
» Customizable Gestures: Users have the flexibility to define and associate their preferred hand gestures with specific in-game actions, allowing for a personalized control scheme.<br />
